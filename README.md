## Game Explanation

As seen in the previous image, a pattern can be observed: per every one element you will win and every two youâ€™ve lose

Choosing an option (eg ROCK) the next element he would beat is [LIZZARD], but he would lose against [SPOCK].

Having found this pattern, the designed solution was to determinate how many positions are between the player and computer elections.

This is achieved using the arithmetic modulus formula, which would be represented by taking the previous example:
```
(2-3)mod5=4` y `(2-4)mod5=3
```
This gives us another pattern and that is that when the result gives an even number you win and when it gives an odd number you lose.

Since there is no arithmetic modulus function in PHP, it would be represented as follows:
```
(human_option - computer_option + total_options) % total_options
```
In this way, it will always give us how many positions there are, even if we take [SCISSORS] vs [SPOCK] which would be:
```
(0-4+5)%5 = 1 // [SPOCK] smashes [SCISSORS]
```
